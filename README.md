## Research

<p align="justify">

As time progressed, tDCS devices have become a more reliable form of treatment to aid in stimulating specific parts of the brain with small amounts of direct electrical currents. Due to the non-invasiveness feature of tDCS, no surgery or operations need to be conducted, it is favorable amongst users/patients. It functions by wrapping an electrode, with electrode gel or saline-soaked sponge pockets, and supplying a constant direct current, typically of low intensity of 1-2 mA, to stimulate the brain. The intensity level of the current is changed based on how much stimulation one’s brain requires, ranging from 0.5 – 2 mA, to meet those needs while still establishing a safe current threshold for users to not suffer brain damage. To ensure that the
correct sections of the brain are being stimulated, it is advised that the user receives an initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to identify the location that needs stimulation and where the electrode should be placed [15].
